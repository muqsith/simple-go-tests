Go programs start from a file that has

package main

and

func main() {}

#  create bin directory under this project directory
    $ mkdir bin

Compilation:

1. Below is the example to compile particular program and keep it in bin/

    $ go build -o bin/hello src/basics/hello/hello.go

2. To build for a target platform (build for linux from Mac)

    $ env GOOS=linux GOARCH=arm go build -o bin/hello src/basics/hello/hello.go

3. To execute the compiled binary and see output
    $ ./bin/hello

4. If you happen to put your code in main package but splitted in multiple files then do as Below
    $ go build -o bin/links src/basics/linking/*.go

    See src/basics/linking for more details

Go programs start from a file that has

package main

and

func main() {}

Compilation:

1. Below is the example to compile particular program and keep it in bin/

    $ go build -o bin/hello src/basics/hello/hello.go

2. To build for a target platform (build for linux from Mac)

    $ env GOOS=linux GOARCH=arm go build -o bin/hello src/basics/hello/hello.go
